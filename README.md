Correcting and Preventing "M"-bias

MBias occurs when a covariate in an adjustment set is a collider (a variable on the colliding path between two other covariates in the adjustment set)

M-bias search is difficult between interrelationships between covariates must be considered, not just the determinants of the exposure and the outcome. 

Right now, there is hard-coding to search for "M"-bias for the relationship between depression as the exposure and Alzheimer's disease as the outcome but future versions will enable search for artibrary exposures and outcomes, and produce complete reports 

## Future work: 
### * Search for "M"-bias variables and confounders for the other eleven modifiable risk factors in the 2020 Lancet Commission report
### * Search for "M"-bias variables and confounders for OMOP
### * Create standardized reports for these
### * Empirical testing of adjustment sets with and without "M"-bias variables to explore the effect on effect measures under different feature selection scenarios
### * Review by human subject-matter experts, literature review
